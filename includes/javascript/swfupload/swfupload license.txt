 * See Changelog.txt for version history
 *
 * Development Notes:
 *  * This version of SWFUpload requires Flash Player 9.0.28 and should autodetect the correct flash version.
 *  * In Linux Flash Player 9 setting the post file variable name does not work. It is always set to "Filedata".
 *  * There is a lot of repeated code that could be refactored to single functions.  Feel free.
 *  * It's dangerous to do "circular calls" between Flash and JavaScript. I've taken steps to try to work around issues
 *     by having the event calls pipe through setTimeout.  However you should still avoid calling in to Flash from
 *     within the event handler methods.  Especially the "startUpload" event since it cannot use the setTimeout hack.
